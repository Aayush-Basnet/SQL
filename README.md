# SQL
Here is where I will keep logs of what I am learning!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Welcome to "SQL-Learning" For Data Analysis!
* In this Git repo, I'll embark on a SQL learning adventure to become a SQL master. Over the next couple of weeks, I'll dive into the world of databases, queires, and data manipulation!
* Get ready to explore SQL fundamentals, tackle complex JOINS, unleash the power of subqueries, and discouver the magic of aggregate functions. With each passing day, I'll levelup my SQL skills.
* Let's make data dance to our tunes!!

# DAY 1 of 'Learning SQL'


### What is SQL?
  SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language for accessing and manipulating database. SQL Lets you access and manipulate database.
  Although SQL is an ANSI/ISO standard, there are different versions of the SQL language. However, to be compliant with ANSI standard, they all support at least the major commands (such as SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT, WHERE) in a similar manners.

What can SQL do? 
* Insert, update, delete record from database
* Create new database
* Create new tables in a database
* Execute queries against a database
* Retrieve data from database

## Database Management System (DBMS)
  * DBMS is a collection of program that enables you to enter the data to the database, organize the data in the database and select data from the database.
  * DBMS manages the process of storing and retrieving data as well as providing users access to the database,
### DBMS Software
Oracle, SQ Lite, MicroSoft SQL, IBM DB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Hadoop HDF


SQL   |  Description    | Commands
----- |---------------- |------------
Data Definition Language (DDL) | DDL commands are used to define and manage the structure of the database, including tables, views, indexes, and constraints. |CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE, RENAME
Data Manipulation Language (DML) |DML commands are used to manipulate and retrieve data within the database. | SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.


# DAY 2

* Today I learn about SQL syntax used during data analysis.
SQL statement consists of keyworks.
  Some of the most important SQL commands
  *	SELECT – Extracts data from database
  *	UPDATE – update data in a database
  *	DELETE – delete data from a database
  *	INSERT INTO – Insert new data into a database
  *	CREATE DATABASE – creates a database
  *	ALTER DATABASE – modifies a database
  *	CREATE TABLE – creates a new table
  *	ALTER TABLE – modifies a table
  *	DROP TABLE – delete a table
  *	CREATE INDEX – creates an index (search key)
  *	DROP INDEX – deletes an index



### Data Definition Language 
SQL Commands   |  Description
---------------|-------------
CREATE         |This command is used to create the database or its objects (like table, index, function, views, store procedure, and triggers)
ALTER         | 	This is used to alter the structure of the database.
DROP          | This command is used to delete objects from the database.
TRUNCATE      | This is used to remove all records from a table, including all spaces allocated for the records are removed.


# DAY 3
